2. Communicate the price, if the client is okay with it. 

3. Build a Wireframe, a model of site that is going to be builded, make exchange with the client if he/she wants to make changes to it, or just proceed with the current model. 

4. The model had been select a 75% of the payment is required to be done. 

5. Development begins when 75% of payment is done, the client is informed about anything new that is been built & it is left with him/her for the review. The changes can be made, if the client demands it.

6. The website is to be tested on different browsers & devices, any problems will be tried to be removed.
